This is the Rock Paper Scissors challenge in the Javascript Foundations section of the Odin Project found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

Originally, to play this game, you had to open your browser development tools and click on the console. However, now there is a basic interface with buttons that use event handling to play the game.
